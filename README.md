Facial Recognition with Smile Detection (Java/OpenCV)
- Java program written to recognise faces, utilising the features provided in OpenCV, alongside the Haar and LBP Cascade Classifiers in order to recognise facial features.
- Smile detection included via usage of the Haar smile cascade, in order to recognise a prolonged smile in the subsection of a webcam frame determined to be a face via the prior classifications.
- Facial recognition done using the opencv contrib library, using EigenFaces in order to recognise a given face. TBD: Implementing the recognition into live webcam.
